# Test-Driven Development

TDD is the red → green loop. This skill is the reference that makes that loop produce tests worth keeping: what a good test is, where tests go, the anti-patterns, and the rules of the loop.

## What a good test is

Tests verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't. A good test reads like a specification: "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists, and it survives refactors because it doesn't care about internal structure.

## Seams: where tests go

A **seam** is the public boundary you test at: the interface where you observe behavior without reaching inside. Tests live at seams, never against internals.

**Test only at pre-agreed seams.** Before writing any test, write down the seams under test and confirm them with the user. No test is written at an unconfirmed seam.

Ask: "What's the public interface, and which seams should we test?"

## Anti-patterns

- **Implementation-coupled**: mocks internal collaborators, tests private methods, or verifies through a side channel. The tell: the test breaks when you refactor but behavior hasn't changed.
- **Tautological**: the assertion recomputes the expected value the way the code does, so it passes by construction. Expected values must come from an independent source of truth.
- **Horizontal slicing**: writing all tests first, then all implementation. Work in **vertical slices** instead: one test → one implementation → repeat.

## Rules of the loop

- **Red before green.** Write the failing test first, then only enough code to pass it. Don't anticipate future tests or add speculative features.
- **One slice at a time.** One seam, one test, one minimal implementation per cycle.
- **Refactoring is not part of the loop.** It belongs to the review stage, not the red → green implementation cycle.

## Integration with this project

- Use `venv/bin/pytest -q` to run tests
- Tests go in `tests/test_<module>.py`
- Fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` (BD test cloning, client, login)
- Never run tests against production databases
- Patch email services, never send real emails
